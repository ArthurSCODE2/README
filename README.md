# Introduction
To create this algorithm, you would need to survey your students and ask how they want their final grade to be spilt up. After you gather the data, I would organize the responses and attempt to find a pattern of similiar answers. Once that is complete, you will be able to start creating an algorithm. 


# Requirements
Any Python Compiler


# Pseudo Code
My design would be to take in my results and create a grade calculator to calucate a final grade. For example:
 My classmates decided to have their final grade percentage spilt up to 60 % for labs/assignments, 30 % for quizzes/tests, and 10 % for discussions 
 The basic grade calculator would return a final letter grade A - D.

# Configuration 
To set this up I would get a sample size of classmates. I would attempt tp create a mini gradebook. I would add a comment where it includes the students name. For each person I would create a variable that is unique to them. For example, if a persons name was James T; the varible would be "james." I would also create variables for labs/assignments, quizzes/tests, and discussions. I would add an array with the socres the students recieved in the different sections of the percentages. One cool thing about python is the fact that their is an average function. I would call the values in the different arrays to get the total average. I would use a basic if statements and else statements to return a letter grade.
